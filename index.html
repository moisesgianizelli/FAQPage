						Repair of Faulty Goods

					<div class ="answer">
					<p>
						Goods returned for repair will be assessed and/or repaired within a reasonable time frame. These times may vary due to reasons beyond both our control and the repairer’s, i.e. part availability or incorrect fault description.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may be required to pay labour, assessment and/or freight fees if goods are determined to have been damaged by misuse or accidental damage.
					</p>
						If any goods that you return are capable of retaining user generated data such as files stored on a hard drive, telephone numbers stored on a mobile phone and songs stored on a portable media player, the replacement or repair of the goods may result in loss of the data. In these circumstances, we recommend you back up data to prevent data loss, and remove sensitive or confidential data, as a party assessing and/or repairing your goods may be required to view data in the course of carrying out the assessment. We will not be responsible for any data loss.
					<p>
						In some circumstances, goods presented for repair may be replaced by refurbished goods of the same type rather than being repaired. Refurbished parts may be used to repair the goods.
